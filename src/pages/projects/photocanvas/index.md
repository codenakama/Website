I created this project to prove myself I could build a relatively useful application with a nice user interface using the UWP framework for Windows 10. At the time I thought a good chunk of the apps in the store lacked in design and were somewhat dubious. I also liked the the Windows 10 APIs, they were easy for me to pickup even moreso because they were available in C#, which is a language I am quite familiar with and use on a daily basis.

I used the design guidelines offered by Microsoft and dribble to make sure I was following modern standards and then set myself to design a simple buy nice UI with Sketch - at least what I thought was a good one and based on the feedback I got.

After releasing the app I started getting some feedback, most of them positive, which made me feel like I was on the right track. I had started with nothing and had my app finally in the store, people using it and sending me feedback - wow! A few people even suggested some improvements based on use cases they required for the app, like the ability to change the background automatically on a daily basis or by setting a time interval. Others wanted to be able to save the images. Because I didn't believe in Microsoft supporting the platform and because of life and work I ended up not releasing any relevant updates to the app, I even have a version with a requested feature still not deployed. Maybe when Microsoft sorts out windows 10 store and the whole mobile strategy I will be back to the platform and make a huge update to PhotoCanvas. Meanwhile I consider this project abandoned but successful as I achieved the goals I wanted to.
