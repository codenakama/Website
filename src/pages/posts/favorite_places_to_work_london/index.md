As a developer I have to catch up on new technologies either by reading documentation or going through some tutorial. Also, as many other developers, I have my own side projectsâ€Šâ€”â€Šthings I like to create, ideas and concepts I like to explore. I usually do this from home, but sometimes I find it more productive to go out somewhere nice in London, take a walk and settle in a nice coffee shop, library or book store. Even if it's just to get me out of the house really!

I decided then to compile a list of the places I've been to once or more times along with some useful information.

1. **The Bike Shed**â€Šâ€”â€ŠShoreditch

The Bike Shed is one of the coolest places I've found in London. It's like a mini motorbike museum, a restaurant, a barber shop, a chillout space and a clothing store all seamlessly combined in one. It's a quite spacious venue and also a fancy one. Great staff, good food and comfy sofas which they allow you to move aroundâ€Šâ€”â€Šyou know, in case you need to be closer to the power extensions ðŸ˜Š.

* Wifi
* Power plugs
* Comfy sofas
* Food and drinks

First time at The Bike Shedâ€Šâ€”â€Šmy friend Bogdan at top very focused.

2\. **Ace Hotel**â€Šâ€”â€ŠShoreditch

The hotel lobby of Ace Hotel in Shoreditch Hight Street is very famous. At any time you can find people working from there, relaxing or having a drink. There is a huge tableâ€Šâ€”â€Šmain attraction, always busyâ€Šâ€”â€Šmany comfortable seats, a coffee area and a drinks and cocktails bar, also with a couple more seats. The WiFi signal is usually good, only once it wasn't working properly. I've been there several times and it's usually my go to place and from there I either meet with a friend or move to The Bike Shed when the place is too busy.

3\. [**Tina We Salute You**][8]**â€Š**â€”â€ŠEast Village, Stratford

Located in the trendy East Village in Stratford, Tina We Salute is my favorite place to work from. It's close to my homeâ€Šâ€”â€Šabout 15 minutes walkâ€Šâ€”â€Šand the staff is really cool and attentive. I engaged once in a conversation with the owner about gaming, more specifically Zelda and the new Nintendo Switch.

The space is usually calm and the background music is nice. It's also right in front of the Olympic park in case you feel like taking a walk or relax.

* Wifi
* Power plugs
* Many and comfy seatsâ€Šâ€”â€Šsofas, tables and chairs
* Food and drinks ðŸ˜‹

I plan to update this list as I explore more. There are some other places I've been to, that I enjoyed working from but I'm trying to make this list as good and curated as possible. Let me know which ones you have been to and like!
